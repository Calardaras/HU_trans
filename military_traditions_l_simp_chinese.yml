 greek_seleucid_path_3:0 "Mounted Innovations III"

 greek_states_path_3:0 "Infantry/Ranged Innovations III"
 greek_states_path_3_desc:0 "Nobody can claim to be masters of siegecraft as much as the Greeks.

Due to such frequent battles, wars between states resulted in a style of warfare which yielded the lowest number of casualties, but highest number of prisoners. The victor would then keep them as slaves, or ransom them back to their opponents for a hefty fee."

 greek_antigonid_path_6_desc:0 "Archery and the use of the sling was minor in the Hellenistic period, although the bespoke lead pellets employed by slingers acted as a formidable deterrent to enemy troops. Cretan archers were widely regarded as the best in their field."

 #Latin Tribal Path
 latin_tribal_path_1:0 "Mounted Innovations I"
 latin_tribal_path_1_desc:0 "Even after the advent of iron-working, magnificent bronze shields, spears, and helmets of all kind, pour from the forges of nascent Italic civilizations. Even tribal cultures possessed a mixture of potent bronze and iron equipment, rendering them a fearsome sight to behold."
 latin_tribal_path_2:0 "Mounted Innovations II"
 latin_tribal_path_2_desc:0 "In Rome, the equites constituted an entire sub-class of patricians; wealthy aristocracy whose holdings indicated their prestige. As such, the superior wealth and training of the equites afforded them the liability to serve in the exclusive cavalry contingent of the republic's forces. Elsewhere in the Italic world, warhorses were regarded as the domain of the elite, the horses themselves often being laid to rest alongside their earthly masters in the event of their death."
 latin_tribal_path_3:1 "Mounted Innovations III"
 latin_tribal_path_3_desc:0 "Relying on the devoutness of their own soldiers, and that of their opponents, the Etruscan forces are reputed to have used their priestly orders to curse their foes in plain sight, causing them to rout. In any event, the peoples of ancient Italy left nothing to chance; proper obeisance was made to the gods, before each battle was made."
 latin_tribal_path_4:0 "Mounted Innovations IV"
 latin_tribal_path_4_desc:0 "Italic tribal cultures, and the nascent Roman Republic all engaged in the practices of raiding, pillaging, and piracy, at times. From the mythical rape of the Sabine women, to the siege of Veii, instances of looting are present throughout the history of Italy."
 latin_tribal_path_5:0 "Mounted Innovations V"
 latin_tribal_path_5_desc:0 "Numerous musical instruments are depicted in Etruscan art, but none more mysterious than the Aulos.

 latin_tribal_path_6:0 "Mounted Innovations VI"
 latin_tribal_path_6_desc:0 "The coast played a huge part in the economic life of Italy. Ships, and viable control over the locality, were vital for the continuation of prosperity in every nascent state. Skilled shipwrights, cheap labor, and abundant building material could be found in all Mediterranean harbors."
 latin_tribal_path_7:0 "Mounted Innovations VII"
 latin_tribal_path_7_desc:0 "The popularity of the Hellenic model of democracy spearheaded the empowerment of populist sentiment throughout a land hungry for rights. A skilled orator could sway entire cities in support of his or her cause, which could, at times, be useful."
 latin_tribal_path_end_bonus:0 "Mounted Innovations Bonus"
 latin_tribal_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "From the Apennines to the Alps, hills and mountains were an ever-present feature of Italian life. It might be said that our armies are more accustomed than most, to the foot-slogging associated with fighting in adverse conditions."
 #Latin Support Path
 latin_support_path_1:0 "Infantry Innovations I"
 latin_support_path_1_desc:0 "During the first Punic war, the Roman senate mandated the construction of a navy to rival that of their foe, the Carthaginian Empire. Modelled largely on the Carthaginian designs as well as sporting significant Greek influence, the enthusiasm for naval dominance continued throughout Rome's republican era."
 latin_support_path_2:0 "Infantry Innovations II"
 latin_support_path_2_desc:0 "The military engineers of the early Roman army were responsible for the design of military structures, as well as the logistical duties associated with organizing their construction."
 latin_support_path_3:0 "Infantry Innovations III"
 latin_support_path_3_desc:0 "Siege engines were scarcely used in the early Republic, sieges instead relying on covert attempts to scale the walls as well as sieges of attrition. During the siege of Veii, around 396 BC, the Roman engineers reputedly proved their worth by boring a great tunnel beneath the walls of the Etruscan city, breaking the siege once and for all."
 latin_support_path_4:0 "Infantry Innovations IV"
 latin_support_path_4_desc:0 "Cohorts, and later legions, were adept at constructing temporary; and in many cases permanent, fortresses, which served as resupply depots, rallying points, or as bases to extend a zone of military control over an unpacified area."
 latin_support_path_5:0 "Infantry Innovations V"
 latin_support_path_5_desc:0 "As the Roman military expanded, the practice of each soldier providing his own weapons became unsustainable. Thus, by instituting a chain of supply, from natural resources, to blacksmith, to the hands of her soldiers, Rome fueled her war machine with ease."
 latin_support_path_6:0 "Infantry Innovations VI"
 latin_support_path_6_desc:0 "Adopting the iconic shield, the scutum, alongside the development of the manipular system, gave Rome a decisive advantage over her local enemies.

 latin_support_path_7:0 "Infantry Innovations VII"
 latin_support_path_7_desc:0 "Rome's primary source of cavalry in the mid-republic, had shifted from the equites to mercenaries and allied states. This allowed a diverse array of styles and abilities to be incorporated into the ever-growing Roman military."
 latin_support_path_end_bonus:0 "Infantry Innovations Bonus"
 latin_support_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "After a great victory, Roman custom dictated that honor be paid to the responsible commander.

 latin_roman_path_3:0 "Logistics Innovations III"

 latin_roman_path_4:0 "Logistics Innovations IV"
 latin_roman_path_4_desc:0 "Often credited with winning entire wars, the practice of using the military to build roads, both in peace time and in conflict, was literally world-shaping."
 latin_roman_path_5:0 "Logistics Innovations V"
 latin_roman_path_5_desc:0 "The evolution of a levied fighting force into a professional standing army, paid dividends in terms of quality and expectation. The salaried soldier was much less likely to baulk at orders, or flee from combat."
 latin_roman_path_6:0 "Logistics Innovations VI"
 latin_roman_path_6_desc:0 "Comprised predominantly of young, unproven soldiers, the velites were light troops which fell outside the standard army organisation, instead acting as mobile skirmishers. The Velites are said to have sought glory and recognition by their daredevil acts during battle."
 latin_roman_path_7:0 "Logistics Innovations VII"
 latin_roman_path_7_desc:0 "As Rome grew in stature, military service became a matter of honor for young Roman men. Indeed, even after defeats as humiliating as the Battle of Cannae, in which up to 80,000 of Rome's soldiers were reportedly killed, the efforts of the senate were able to raise enough soldiers to take the places of the fallen."
 latin_roman_path_2:0 "Logistics Innovations II"
 latin_roman_path_2_desc:0 "The triple battle line was a manipular formation, primarily utilizing the Principes, Triarii and Hastati, with the Velites in freeform support. This highly flexible formation relied on the absolute discipline of each soldier, who had to know his place amidst the chaos of battle. In extreme circumstances, the Triplex was said to have reached over a mile long."

 mauryan_mauryas_path_2_desc:0 "Elephants had long been used for warfare by Indian states. Undomesticated, elephants tend to lead a peaceful, grazing lifestyle; however, when trained for war, the thick skinned colossi act as a living battering ram, breaking enemy infantry formations as a man might swat a fly."

 mauryan_mauryas_path_7_desc:0 "The systematic integration of tribal cultures into the highly efficient Mauryan bureaucracy was achieved largely by legislating them out of existence.
